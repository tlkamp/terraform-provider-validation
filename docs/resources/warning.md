# validation_warning (Resource)

Causes a warning to be printed if the condition is true.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "one" {}
variable "two" {}

resource "validation_warning" "warn" {
  condition = var.one == var.two
  summary = "var.one and var.two are equal. This will cause an error in future versions"
  details = <<EOF
In a future release of this code, var.one and var.two may no longer be equal. Please consider modifying the values to
be distinct to avoid execution failures.
var.one: ${var.one}
var.two: ${var.two}
EOF
}
```
