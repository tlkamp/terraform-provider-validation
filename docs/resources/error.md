# validation_error (Resource)

Causes an error to be thrown during execution if the condition is true.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "one" {}
variable "two" {}

resource "validation_error" "error" {
  condition = var.one == var.two
  summary = "var.one and var.two must never be equal"
  details = <<EOF
When var.one and var.two are equal, bad things can happen.
Please use differing values for these inputs.
